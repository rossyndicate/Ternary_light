[["index.html", "Ternary Light Partitioning Motivation and Introduction 0.1 Workflow", " Ternary Light Partitioning Dr. Matthew Ross Dr. Jim Jawitz Dr. Matt Cohen December 14, 2023 Motivation and Introduction Water clarity and its components (chlorophyll a, total suspended sediment (TSS), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) are among the most functionally important and socially-relevant aspects of water quality. Here we propose a method for systematically evaluating the relative contribution of each water clarity component to total clarity [[water column light extinction?]], a value derived from Secchi disk depth. We further borrow a visualization tool from soil analyses, the ternary diagram to describe these contributions: we build ternary diagrams that partition light partitioning between DOC mass, derived algal biomass, and derived non-algal mass. [[add conceptual ternary diagram]] 0.1 Workflow [[is it intentional to use particle and mass/biomass interchangeably? Consider a high-level consolidation of language below, I changed the above text to be mass/biomass.]] In its simplest form our workflow contains the following steps: Download all of AquaSat, a data set of four water quality parameters collated for the conterminous United States, and join the AquaSat pieces together to create a harmonized data set of the four parameters. Investigate the relationship between chlorohpyll a, TIS (inorganic sediment, derived from TSS), algal biomass (derived from chlorophyll a) and non-algal particles (derived from algal biomass and DOC). Create a dataset of algal biomass, non-algal particle mass, and dissolved organic carbon mass. Investigate data quality of AquaSat and select a subset of data where chlorophyll a, DOC, TSS and Secchi and create a dataset where all parameters were all measured simultaneously. Build a model that predicts light extinction using algal biomass, non-algal particles, and DOC where light extinction (K) is defined as: \\[ K = 1.4 / {Sechhi\\:Disk\\:Depth} \\] [[note, the value I’ve seen for the constant is 1.7 (see Poole and Atkins 1929), maybe cite here the associated paper for use of 1.4?]] Use this model to extract light extinction coefficients relative to each parameter (algal biomass, non-algal mass, DOC mass) and apply this model to visualizations in ternary space. Explore systematic controls on relative contribution to light extinction over space and time across CONUS.
